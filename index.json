Complex Wrinkle Fields consist of an almost-everywhere-unit complex-valued phase function over the surface; a frequency one-form; and an amplitude scalar, with a soft compatibility condition coupling the frequency and phase. We develop algorithms for interpolating between two such wrinkle fields, for visualizing them as displacements of a Loop-subdivided refinement of the base mesh, and for making smooth local edits to the wrinkle amplitude, frequency, and/or orientation. These algorithms make it possible, for the first time, to create and edit animations of wrinkles on triangle meshes that are smooth in space, evolve smoothly through time, include singularities along with their complex interactions, and that represent frequencies far finer than the surface resolution.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Complex Wrinkle Field Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Chen","Zherong Pan","Kui Wu","Etienne Vouga","Xifeng Gao"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"aea40b6d55a60d6afcea2b2ddb9776e8","permalink":"https://zhenchen-jay.github.io/publication/robustlowpolymeshing/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/robustlowpolymeshing/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a robust re-meshing approach that can automatically generate visual-preserving low-poly meshes for any high-poly models found in the wild. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into current mesh-based 3D asset production pipelines. Given an input high-poly, our method proceeds in two stages: 1) Robustly extracting an offset surface mesh that is feature preserving, and guaranteed to be watertight, manifold, and self-intersection free; 2) Progressively simplifying and flowing the offset mesh to bring the simplified mesh close to the input. The simplicity and the visual-preservation of the generated low-poly is controlled by a user required target screen size of the input: decreasing the screen size reduces the element count of the low-poly but enlarges its visual difference from the input. We have evaluated our method on a subset of the Thingi10K dataset that contains models created by practitioners in different domains, with varying topological and geometric complexities.

In this work, we propose Neural Volumetric Mesh Generator (NVMG), which can generate novel and high-quality volumetric meshes. Unlike the previous 3D generative model for point cloud, voxel, and implicit surface, the volumetric mesh representation is a ready-to-use representation in industry with details on both the surface and interior. Generating this such highly-structured data thus brings a significant challenge. We first propose a diffusion-based generative model to tackle this problem by generating voxelized shapes with close-to-reality outlines and structures. We can simply obtain a tetrahedral mesh as a template with the voxelized shape. Further, we use a voxel-conditional neural network to predict the smooth implicit surface conditioned on the voxels, and progressively project the tetrahedral mesh to the predicted surface under regularizations. The regularization terms are carefully designed so that they can (1) get rid of the defects like flipping and high distortion; (2) force the regularity of the interior and surface structure during the deformation procedure for a high-quality final mesh. As shown in the experiments, our pipeline can generate high-quality artifact-free volumetric and surface meshes from random noise or a reference image without any post-processing. Compared with the state-of-the-art voxel-to-mesh deformation method, we show more robustness and better performance when taking generated voxels as input.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Neural Volumetric Mesh Generator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Chen","Zherong Pan","Kui Wu","Etienne Vouga","Xifeng Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660059900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660059900,"objectID":"8950fb31ac14865927850c19de3658b4","permalink":"https://zhenchen-jay.github.io/talk/robust-low-poly-meshing-for-general-3d-models/","publishdate":"2022-08-09T15:45:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/robust-low-poly-meshing-for-general-3d-models/","section":"event","summary":"We propose a robust re-meshing approach that can automatically generate visual-preserving low-poly meshes for any high-poly models found in the wild.

This model predicts global, fine-scale wrinkling at frequencies much higher than the resolution of the coarse mesh; moreover, it is grounded in the geometric analysis of elasticity, and does not require manual guidance, a corpus of training examples, nor tuning of ad-hoc parameters. We first approximate the coarse shape of the shell using tension field theory, in which material forces do not resist compression. We then augment this base mesh with wrinkles, parameterized by an amplitude and phase field that we solve for over the base mesh, which together characterize the geometry of the wrinkles. We validate our approach against both physical experiments and numerical simulations, and show that our algorithm produces wrinkles qualitatively similar to those predicted by traditional shell solvers requiring orders of magnitude more degrees of freedom.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Fine Wrinkling on Coarsely Meshed Thin Shells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Chen","Daniele Panozzo","Jérémie Dumas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594126800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594126800,"objectID":"d63b43f7000d4705b79aca66129169a2","permalink":"https://zhenchen-jay.github.io/talk/half-space-power-diagrams-and-discrete-surface-offsets/","publishdate":"2020-07-07T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/half-space-power-diagrams-and-discrete-surface-offsets/","section":"event","summary":"We present an efficient, trivially parallelizable algorithm to compute offset surfaces of shapes discretized using a dexel data structure.

Our algorithm is based on a two-stage sweeping procedure that is simple to implement and efficient, entirely avoiding volumetric distance field computations typical of existing methods. Our construction is based on properties of half-space power diagrams, where each seed is only visible by a half-space, which were never used before for the computation of surface offsets. The primary application of our method is interactive modeling for digital fabrication. Our technique enables a user to interactively process high-resolution models. It is also useful in a plethora of other geometry processing tasks requiring fast, approximate offsets, such as topology optimization, collision detection, and skeleton extraction. We present experimental timings, comparisons with previous approaches, and provide a reference implementation in the supplemental material.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Half-Space Power Diagrams and Discrete Surface Offsets","type":"publication"}]
