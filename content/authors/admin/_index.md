I am a Ph.D. candicate in <a href=https://www.cs.utexas.edu />Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href=https://www.utexas.edu /> The University of Texas at Austin</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/evouga />Etienne Vouga</a>. My research majorly focuses on understanding the physical phenomenon of thin shell models, explore the corresponding geometric properties, and robust mesh processing. I am also interested in exploring the possibility to combine the cloth simulation with deep neutral networks.

Prior to joining in UT Austin, I recieved my bachelor degree in Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China, in July 2018, where I worked with Prof. <a href=http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu /> Ligang Liu</a>.
