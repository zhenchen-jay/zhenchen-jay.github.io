title: Fine wrinkling on Coarsely Meshed Thin Shells

event: SIGGRAPH 2022
event_url: https://s2022.siggraph.org/full-program/

location: Vancouver Converntion Centre

summary: ''
abstract: 'We propose a new model and algorithm to capture the high-definition statics of thin shells via coarse meshes. This model predicts global, fine-scale wrinkling at frequencies much higher than the resolution of the coarse mesh'
