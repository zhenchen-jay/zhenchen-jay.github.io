title: 'Half-Space Power Diagrams and Discrete Surface Offsets'

event: Symposium on Geometry Processing 2020
event_url: https://sgp2020.sites.uu.nl/

location: Online SGP Conference

summary: ''
abstract: 'We present an efficient, trivially parallelizable algorithm to compute offset surfaces of shapes discretized using a dexel data structure. Our algorithm is based on a two-stage sweeping procedure that is simple to implement and efficient, entirely avoiding volumetric distance field computations typical of existing methods. '
